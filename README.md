# NC News

Welcome to **Nc News**, a Reddit-style news aggregation app where users may browse articles, view and post comments for specific articles, as well as having the ability to vote on articles.

This is the front-end for the project built with **React** and using a [custom **RESTful API**](https://github.com/RafalbCzajka/nc-news-API) for data.
